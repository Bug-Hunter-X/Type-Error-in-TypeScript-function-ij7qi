This repository contains a demonstration of a common type error in TypeScript, where a function expecting a string argument is called with an array of strings.  The bug.ts file shows the erroneous code, resulting in a type error.  The bugSolution.ts file provides a corrected version, illustrating how to handle this error by either modifying the function's signature to accept an array or by iterating over the array and calling the function for each element.
